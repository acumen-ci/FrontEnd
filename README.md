# Acucafe Front end exercise

## Project requirements

This project runs on Angular 11

It uses Angular material 11

## Brief

You have been chosen to refactor and optimise the ordering page for AcuCafe. They are happy for you to do anything with the code however want you to consider performance, scalability and best practices when doing so.

AcuCafe has an ordering system which is poorly designed and sometime fails to deliver the right orders. For example, some of the clients complain that their ice tea had milk in it. The system has also turned out to be a maintenance nightmare as they add new drinks every month and this is difficult to do. They have hired you to solve these problems.

The client has asked for the following (work down the list)

- Stop the preparation of an ice tea with milk and inform the barista
- Errors should be handled both front and back end
- Fix the order summary so it displays the drink and cost
- It should look like the designs in Figma: [here](https://www.figma.com/file/oqGXgrX6769HUXv37t5tFM/Front-End-AcuCafe?type=design&node-id=26%3A3783&mode=design&t=h9QNdfPBo964hnLm-1)
- See the cost with toppings before placing an order
