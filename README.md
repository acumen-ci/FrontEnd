# Acucafe Front end exercise

## Project requirements

This project runs on Angular 11

It uses Angular material 11


## Brief

You have been chosen to refactor and optimise the ordering page for Acucafe. They are happy for you to do anything with the code however want you to consider performance, scalability and best practices when doing so. 

One feature that has been asked for though is they do not allow milk to be selected with Ice tea. So the user should not be able to enter it. They also want you to consider how a  user could add different drinks in one order, currently they can only order 1.

The project should match the [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/9N9zM1e6XkBhxGtfAPCB2t/Full-Stack-AcuCafe?node-id=0%3A1).
